HIerarchy of DEFinitions
`

First principles thinking is the act of boiling a process down to the fundamental parts that you know are true and building up from there.

The most fundamental concepts make up the very bottom of the hierarchy of definitions. The ground level (zero level) definitios to not have any references to other definitions. The are purely describe without usage of other concepts. The higher a concept is places in the hierarchy the higher level definitions it can reference too. A definition can only reference to other definition on a lower level. Hierarchy of definitions has a structure of a tree.

# PrecDef

Hierarchy of precise (precious) definitions
`

## What?

First principles thinking is the act of boiling a process down to the fundamental parts that you know are true and building up from there.

The most fundamental concepts make up the very bottom of the hierarchy of definitions. The ground level (zero level) definitios do not have any references to other definitions. The are purely describe without usage of other concepts. The higher a concept is places in the hierarchy the higher level definitions it can reference too. A definition can only reference to another definition from a lower level. Hierarchy of definitions has a structure of a tree.

## Why?

The target is to create a knowledge model when one can start from a foundamental concepts and climb to higher level of hierarchy. Picking a single definition, the children nodes indicate what should be firstly understand to fully understand the definition.

Over time, the tree can be updated with more precise and better placed definitions. It is a kind of living systematic review of a specific branch of knowledge.

Keeping the tree structure enforce us to build a definition on top of the more general concepts. It makes it clear how specific is the concept we try to define. Going down in the hierarchy we reach a low level definitions that are more general and fundamental. Climping up on the hierarchy tree we learn more specific, high level concepts.

The tree is going to be precise and well arranged knowledge structure. It can be used by humans and artificial intelligence systems as well.

Abstract data type (ADT) is a mathematical model for [data types](/computer_science/levels/00002/data_type.md), defined by its behavior from the point of view of a user of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible [operations](/computer_science/levels/00003/operation.md) on data of this [type](/computer_science/levels/00002/data_type.md), and the behavior of these [operations](/computer_science/levels/00003/operation.md).

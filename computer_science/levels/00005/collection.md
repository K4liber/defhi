# collection

Collection is an [abstract data type](/computer_science/levels/00004/abstract_data_type.md) that groups some variable number of [data objects](/computer_science/levels/00002/data_object.md) (possibly zero) that have some shared significance to the problem being solved and need to be [operated](/computer_science/levels/00003/operation.md) upon together in some controlled fashion.
